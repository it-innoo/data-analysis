# Welcome to Data analysis with Python - Summer 2019

In this course an overview is given of different phases of the data analysis pipeline using Python and its data analysis ecosystem. What is typically done in data analysis? We assume that data is already available, so we only need to download it. After downloading the data it needs to be cleaned to enable further analysis. In the cleaning phase the data is converted to some uniform and consistent format. After which the data can, for instance, be

  *  combined or divided into smaller chunks
  *  grouped or sorted,
  *  condensed into small number of summary statistics
  *  numerical or string operations can be performed on the data
